"# AAPM_Summer_School" 
This code is adapated from the voxelmorph code (https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) for the purposes of teaching introductory biomechanical modeling and deep learning

The purpose of this work is to create a simple way to visualize deep learning architectures and learn how to best train a model
